# OIDC Workshop

- We want to do the tutorial [oidc-workshop](https://github.com/andifalk/secure-oauth2-oidc-workshop)
- The [slides](https://andifalk.github.io/oidc-workshop-spring-io-2019/#/) contains the corresponding theory.
- We want to do it local first.
- If it works we will deploy it on openshift.

## Preparation
- install Intelli/J
- install git and check commit
- install Postman
- complete Springboot tutorials by Joachim Prinzbach as shown in https://confluence.baloisenet.com/atlassian/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1840186564
