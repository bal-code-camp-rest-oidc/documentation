# Fifth Day, 25.09.2020

On that last day we only had half of a day as we also had to travel back home.

## Sample Application
In the sample application we added secure swagger access so that we were able to test our services:
- Library User Service: http://localhost:9093/library-users/swagger-ui/index.html

Additionally we kept on refactoring and migration to our new business case.

We still leave some work open:
- finish the facade REST server
- add swagger to all REST resources
- WHAT ELSE?

## Deployment

WHAT ELSE?
