# Basic, Digest und Bearer Token 
**Basic authentication** transmits credentials as user ID/password pairs, encoded using base64. The client sends HTTP
requests with the Authorization header that contains the word Basic word followed by a space and a base64-encoded
string username:password. 

```
Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpwQDU1dzByZA==
```

*Note*: For basic authentication, as the user ID and password are passed over the network as clear text (it is base64
encoded, but base64 is a reversible encoding), the basic authentication scheme is not secure. HTTPS / TLS should be
used in conjunction with basic authentication. 

**Bearer authentication** (also called token authentication) has security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer
authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string,
usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization
header when making requests to protected resources:  

```
Authorization: Bearer < token >
```

*Note*: Similarly to Basic authentication, Bearer authentication should only be used over HTTPS (SSL).
